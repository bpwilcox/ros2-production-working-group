* Quality builds are green (address sanitizer, thread sanitizer, clang thread safety analysis)
* Test suite passes
* Code coverage is measured, and non-decreasing level is enforced in PRs
* Issues and pull requests receive prompt responses
* Releases go out regularly when bugfixes or new features are introduced
* The backlog is maintained, avoiding longstanding stale issues
